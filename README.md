After researching quite a bit from various sources about how you can encrypt your local files with most hardened way possible when it comes to OpenPGP symmetric encryption, I happened to write this bash script for myself.

## Few key points to remember:
1. Use a long passphrase. You can use a password manager for this.
2. Minimum character length of your passpharse should be 8. Else, OpenPGP won't accept it.
